# Arduino - AVR GCC multiplication

Implementation of various multiplication routines for AVR microprocessor. Tested on ATmega168 (Arduino).

See [my blog article](http://mekonik.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/arduino-avr-gcc-multiplication/) for details.

You can do anything you want with the code. I release it to *public domain*.
